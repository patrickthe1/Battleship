PROJECT OBJECTIVES
The goal of this project is to build the classic web version of the game "battleship" where two players take turns 
guessing where to place their shots on the grid to destroy the opponents fleet of ships.


### Core Features

1. **Game Board Initialization**:
   - Create a grid (typically 10x10) for each player.
   - Use a 2D array to represent the game board and store the state of each cell (e.g., empty, ship, hit, miss).

2. **Ship Placement**:
   - Allow players to place their ships on the board.
   - Implement validation to ensure ships are placed within bounds and do not overlap.
   - Different ship lengths may be used (e.g., carrier: 5, battleship: 4, cruiser: 3, submarine: 3, destroyer: 2).

3. **Game Mechanics**:
   - Implement turn-based play where each player takes turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships.
   - Provide an interface for players to select a cell to attack.
   - Update the game state based on the result of each attack (hit or miss) and inform players.

4. **Win Condition**:
   - Determine win conditions such as when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships.

5. **Game UI**:
   - Create an intuitive user interface to display the game board, ship placements, and hits/misses.
   - Provide feedback to players after each turn (e.g., hit, miss, sunk ship notification).

6. **Reset/Start a New Game**:
   - Provide an option to reset the game and start a new match.

### Optional Features (To be implementred only once the core features have been implemented)

1. **AI Opponent**:
   - Implement algorithms for a computer opponent if you want the game to be played solo.
   - Create a basic AI that randomly selects cells or improves its guessing strategy based on previous hits.

2. **Multiplayer Mode**:
   - Enable online multiplayer functionality using WebSockets or a similar technology to facilitate real-time play between two players.

3. **Animations and Sound Effects**:
   - Add animations for attacks (e.g., explosions for hits) and sound effects for enhancing the gaming experience.

4. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensure the game is responsive and playable on various devices, such as desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

5. **Scorekeeping and Leaderboard**:
   - Add scorekeeping capabilities and a leaderboard to track player statistics over multiple games.

6. **Game Rules & Instructions**:
   - Provide clear instructions on how to play the game, including the rules and ship placements.

### Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structure the game layout.
- **CSS**: Style the game board and UI elements.
- **JavaScript**: Handle game logic, user interactions, and game state management.

### IMPORTANT:
You are to approach this project from a TDD first approach and make sure you explain each part of the process clearly for me to understand and learn how to become better at Test Driven Development. Since we’re doing TDD, it’s important that I don’t get overwhelmed. Take it one step at a time. Write a test, then make it pass.

Below are the general steps that you must follow:
Begin your app by creating the Ship class/factory (your choice).
Your ‘ships’ will be objects that include their length, the number of times they’ve been hit and whether or not they’ve been sunk.
REMEMBER you only have to test your object’s public interface. Only methods or properties that are used outside of your ‘ship’ object need unit tests.
Ships should have a hit() function that increases the number of ‘hits’ in your ship.
isSunk() should be a function that calculates whether a ship is considered sunk based on its length and the number of hits it has received.


Create a Gameboard class/factory.
Note that we have not yet created any User Interface. We should know our code is coming together by running the tests. You shouldn’t be relying on console.log or DOM methods to make sure your code is doing what you expect it to.
Gameboards should be able to place ships at specific coordinates by calling the ship factory or class.
Gameboards should have a receiveAttack function that takes a pair of coordinates, determines whether or not the attack hit a ship and then sends the ‘hit’ function to the correct ship, or records the coordinates of the missed shot.
Gameboards should keep track of missed attacks so they can display them properly.
Gameboards should be able to report whether or not all of their ships have been sunk.
Create a Player class/factory.
There will be two types of players in the game, ‘real’ players and ‘computer’ players.
Each player object should contain its own gameboard.
Import your classes/factories into another file, and drive the game using event listeners to interact with your objects. Create a module that helps you manage actions that should happen in the DOM.
At this point it is appropriate to begin crafting your User Interface.
Set up a new game by creating Players. For now just populate each player’s Gameboard with predetermined coordinates. You are going to implement a system for allowing players to place their ships later.
We’ll leave the HTML implementation up to you for now, but you should display both the player’s boards and render them using information from the Gameboard class/factory.
You’ll need methods to render each player’s Gameboard, so put them in an appropriate module.
Your event listeners should step through the game turn by turn using only methods from other objects. If at any point you are tempted to write a new function, step back and figure out which class or module that function should belong to.
For attacks, let the user click on a coordinate in the enemy Gameboard. Send the user input to methods on your objects, and re-render the boards to display the new information.
Players should take turns playing the game by attacking the enemy Gameboard. If you feel the need to keep track of the current player’s turn, it’s appropriate to manage that in this module, instead of another mentioned object.
The game is played against the computer, so make the ‘computer’ players capable of making random plays. The computer does not have to be smart, but it should know whether or not a given move is legal (i.e. it shouldn’t shoot the same coordinate twice).
Create conditions so that the game ends once one player’s ships have all been sunk. This function is also appropriate for this module.
Finish it up by implementing a system that allows players to place their ships. For example, you can let them type coordinates for each ship or have a button to cycle through random placements.
Extra credit
Make your battleship project more impressive by introducing any of these modifications.

Implement drag and drop to allow players to place their ships.
Create a 2-player option that lets users take turns by passing the laptop back and forth, or by spinning the monitor around on a desktop. Implement a ‘pass device’ screen so that players don’t see each other’s boards!
Polish the intelligence of the computer player by having it try adjacent slots after getting a ‘hit’.

### Version Control and Documentation
- You are to suggest that i  commit and push if a significant change to the application has been made 
- After a change has been committed or after dealing with a specific issue or challenge in the app, It is to be documented in projectContext.md file.
