# Project Context

## Summary of Progress

As of this commit, we have successfully implemented the foundational components of the Battleship game project. The following features have been developed:

1. **Ship Class**:
   - Created a `Ship` class that includes properties for length, hit count, and methods to handle hits and determine if the ship is sunk.
   - Implemented unit tests to ensure the functionality of the `Ship` class.

2. **Gameboard Class**:
   - Developed a `Gameboard` class that manages a 10x10 grid, allowing for ship placement and attack handling.
   - Implemented methods to place ships, receive attacks, and check if all ships are sunk.
   - Added unit tests to verify the correct behavior of the `Gameboard` class.

3. **Player Class**:
   - Created a `Player` class that represents each player in the game, including their name and gameboard.
   - Implemented methods for attacking an opponent's gameboard and placing ships on their own gameboard.
   - Added unit tests to ensure the functionality of the `Player` class.

## Next Steps

Following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach, we are now ready to implement the next phase of the project, which involves creating the game mechanics and user interface. This includes:

- Implementing turn-based play where each player takes turns guessing the location of the opponent's ships.
- Providing an interface for players to select a cell to attack.
- Updating the game state based on the result of each attack (hit or miss) and informing players.
- Creating a user interface to display the game board, ship placements, and hits/misses.
