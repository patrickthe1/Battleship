# Project Context

## Summary of Progress

As of this commit, we have successfully implemented the foundational components of the Battleship game project. The following features have been developed:

1. **Ship Class**:
   - Created a `Ship` class that includes properties for length, hit count, and methods to handle hits and determine if the ship is sunk.
   - Implemented unit tests to ensure the functionality of the `Ship` class.

2. **Gameboard Class**:
   - Developed a `Gameboard` class that manages a 10x10 grid, allowing for ship placement and attack handling.
   - Implemented methods to place ships, receive attacks, and check if all ships are sunk.
   - Added unit tests to verify the correct behavior of the `Gameboard` class.
   - Improved the `receiveAttack` method to separately track hit attacks and missed attacks.

3. **Player Class**:
   - Created a `Player` class that represents each player in the game, including their name and gameboard.
   - Implemented methods for attacking an opponent's gameboard and placing ships on their own gameboard.
   - Added unit tests to ensure the functionality of the `Player` class.

4. **Game Class**:
   - Developed a `Game` class that manages the game flow, including turn switching and win condition checking.
   - Implemented methods for player attacks, ship placement, and turn management.
   - Fixed issues with ship placement to correctly place ships on the respective player's board.
   - Improved the attack logic to properly check for win conditions and handle turn switching.
   - Added unit tests to verify the correct behavior of the `Game` class.

5. **User Interface (Phase 1)**:
   - Created the basic HTML structure for the game with placeholders for player boards and game controls.
   - Implemented CSS styling for the game boards, ships, and UI elements.
   - Developed JavaScript to render the game boards and handle basic user interactions.
   - Set up the foundation for ship placement and attack mechanics.

6. **Ship Placement Interface (Phase 2)**:
   - Implemented ship placement functionality with visual feedback for valid/invalid placements.
   - Added the ability to rotate ships between horizontal and vertical orientations.
   - Created a random placement feature to automatically place ships on the player's board.
   - Implemented validation to prevent invalid ship placements (out of bounds or overlapping).

7. **Game Flow and Attack Mechanics (Phase 3)**:
   - Implemented turn-based gameplay between player and computer.
   - Created attack interface for clicking on the opponent's board.
   - Added visual feedback for hits and misses.
   - Implemented a simple AI for the computer player to make random attacks.
   - Added game state management to track when the game is active.
   - Implemented win condition detection and game end functionality.

## Phase 4: Game State Management (In Progress)

Key improvements:
- Fixed issue with computer ship placement to ensure exactly 5 ships are placed
- Implemented turn-based locking mechanism to prevent players from making consecutive attacks
- Added visual indicators to show whose turn it is
- Enhanced the computer attack logic to prevent duplicate attacks
- Added ship status indicators that update in real-time during gameplay
- Improved feedback messages to inform players of game events
- Applied CSS styling for better visual hierarchy and game state indication

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed issue with excessive number of "X" markers on computer board (fixed ship placement validation)
- Fixed turn management to properly lock player actions during computer's turn
- Added board highlight animation to indicate active player turn
- Updated ships status lists to show current state of ships (active or sunk)

## Next Steps

### Phase 5: Computer Player (AI)
- Enhance computer AI to make smarter attack decisions
- Implement a "hunt and target" strategy after successful hits
- Add difficulty levels for computer player

### Phase 6: Polish and Enhancements
- Add sound effects for hits, misses, and ship sinking
- Implement animations for attacks and ship placements
- Add game statistics tracking (hits, misses, accuracy)
- Create a game over screen with replay option
- Add responsive design for mobile compatibility
